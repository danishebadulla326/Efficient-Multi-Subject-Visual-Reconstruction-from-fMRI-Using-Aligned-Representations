**Abstract:**  
We introduce a novel approach to fMRI-based visual image reconstruction using a subject-agnostic common representation space. By aligning subject-specific lightweight adapters to a pre-trained reference subject, our method achieves efficient and high-quality reconstructions, particularly in low-data scenarios. We validate our approach across multiple datasets and demonstrate improved performance, convergence speed, and generalization compared to traditional end-to-end training strategies.
